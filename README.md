# Triangular 2048

This code is my first (and currently last) experience in game development using JavaScript.

# How To Play

The game is basically a triangular version of 2048 with a simple 3-D animation.

## Keyboard

- 'WEASDF' for moving tiles around.
- 'N' for new game.
- 'U' for undo.

## Mouse/Touch

- Drag and drop for moving tiles.
- Press 'New Game' and see what will happen!
- No undo!
